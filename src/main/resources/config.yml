claim_distance:
  chunks: 1 # How many chunks away from nearby claims can a player create a claim.
  bypass_coop_players: true # If true, allows players to claim chunks adjacent to claims owned by their co-op teammates, ignoring the standard distance rule.

# Hologram Settings
# These settings allow you to customize the color of the "Time Left" field in claim holograms, perfect for matching your server's theme!
#
# How does it work?
# - Each threshold defines a time condition and a color.
# - threshold: Time condition (e.g., "day >= 2", "day < 1", "minute <= 5")
# - color: Color code (e.g., "&a", "&e", "&c", hex: "<#FF0000>")
#
# Thresholds are checked in order; the first matching one is used.
# Example:
#   - threshold: "day >= 2"   -> If days left is 2 or more, use &a (green)
#   - threshold: "day >= 1"   -> If days left is 1 or more, use &e (yellow)
#   - threshold: "day < 1"    -> If days left is less than 1, use &c (red)
#
# Add as many thresholds/colors as you like for your server!
# Tip:
# You don't need to shut down and restart the server or use a full reload to process the thresholds;
# you can apply them in-game by simply using the /nclaim admin reload command.

# Claim Settings
claim_settings:
  max_count: 3        # Maximum number of claims per player
  buy_price: 1500     # Cost to create a new claim
  expand_price: 2000  # Cost to expand an existing claim by one chunk

  # TIERED PRICING SYSTEM (Maximum 117 chunks)
  tiered_pricing:
    enable: false  # true = Tiered system ON, false = Old system (fixed price)

    # HOW IT WORKS:
    # Your claim starts with 1 chunk (main chunk)
    # You can expand up to 117 chunks total
    # Price increases with each tier

    tiers:
      # FIRST 5 CHUNKS FREE (2nd-6th chunks)
      tier1:
        min: 2          # Starting from the 2nd chunk
        max: 6          # Up to 6th chunk
        price: 0        # Free
        # Total free: 5 chunks

      # EASY LEVEL (7th-15th chunks)
      tier2:
        min: 7          # Starting from the 7th chunk
        max: 15         # Up to 15th chunk
        price: 500      # 500 coins per chunk
        # Total: 9 chunks x 500 = 4,500 coins

      # MEDIUM LEVEL (16th-25th chunks)
      tier3:
        min: 16         # Starting from the 16th chunk
        max: 25         # Up to 25th chunk
        price: 1000     # 1000 coins per chunk
        # Total: 10 chunks x 1000 = 10,000 coins

      # HARD LEVEL (26th-35th chunks)
      tier4:
        min: 26         # Starting from the 26th chunk
        max: 35         # Up to 35th chunk
        price: 2500     # 2500 coins per chunk
        # Total: 10 chunks x 2500 = 25,000 coins
